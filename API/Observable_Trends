1.  Clearly the closer one gets to the equator the higher the temperature will be -- this has been proven here.

2.  Although the points tend to be clustered in the other graphs outside of temperature, they show little affect as it relates
        to the equator.
        
3.  The latitude from -20 to +20 will have the highest temperatures -- not exactly at 0 latitude.
