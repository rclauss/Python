1.  The first observable trend would be that we should gear the marketing towards who our customers are.  
        They are mostly a male audience that play in their 20s and in their late 30s.

2.  The purchases by femles, although lower in volume, are actually higher than the average for the entire dataset.  
        When they spend they spend above average.
        
3.  The males massively outweigh the females.  
        I would want to run new products geared at females and see if the male participation drops becuase of that.  
        Women seem to want to buy.
