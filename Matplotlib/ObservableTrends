1.  The rural drivers take less rides, have less competition and have much higher average fares.  Would need some more research 
      but it is probably better to be a rural driver when accounting for gas and time etc.

2.  There is a pretty apparent linear negative correlation between Avg Fare and Number of Rides.

3.  The suburban drivers most likely have a relatively low cost of doing business (taxes, gas, etc.) but can still cash in on avg fare and number of rides.
